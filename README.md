# sourmash_plugin_xyz: a template for sourmash plugins

This is a good place to start if you're writing a plugin for
[sourmash (sourmash-bio/sourmash/)](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash/).

Note: plugins were added in [sourmash v4.7.0](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash/releases/tag/v4.7.0).

## Instructions

You can use this repo as a template repo to create a new plugin!

See [this set of changes](https://github.com/ctb/sourmash_plugin_template_test1/pull/1) for the minimal diff needed to get a plugin working!

### Building from a template:

First, go to [the GitHub page](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash_plugin_template) and click "Use this template" to create a new repository.

Clone that repository into your development space.

Then, search for all places where 'xyz' is present, and replace
'xyz' with the name of your plugin.

Next, edit the code in `src/sourmash_plugin_xyz.py` to implement the plugin
(you'll probably want to change the name of that file, too.)

Then run `pip install .` to install and test your plugin! You can also
run `pip install -e .` to install it in editable mode, which is more
convenient for development.

## Examples

[sourmash_plugin_avro](https://github.com/sourmash-bio/sourmash_plugin_avro)
